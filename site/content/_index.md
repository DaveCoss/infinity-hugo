  heading: About
  text: >-
    We are a group of people who have started churches and ministries throughout
    Africa, China, the South Pacific and Australia. We come from very different
    Christian backgrounds, but are united in vision.


    We are not operating under any kind of institution. We have recognized a need to return to a simpler biblical approach to living a Christian life, where we encounter God outside of the walls. So our time, money and energy can be used to further Gods’ kingdom rather than an organization.

  text: Do you have financial, health, relationship or other areas that you could
    use God’s help with? Do you want someone to talk to confidentially? We
    aren’t looking for anything in return, we just want you to encounter God’s
    power.
